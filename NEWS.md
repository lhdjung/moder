# moder (development version)

-   New functions `frequency_grid_df()` and `frequency_grid_plot()` to analyze and visualize possible frequency distributions given missing values.
-   Fixed a bug in `mode_count_range()` that displayed a maximum of 0 for certain kinds of input.
-   In `mode_possible_min()` and `mode_possible_max()`, the `multiple` argument was renamed to `accept` for greater consistency with `mode_first()` and other functions.

# moder 0.2.1

Patch for CRAN submission.

# moder 0.2.0

-   `mode_count()` and all other metadata functions now have a `max_unique` argument, allowing users to encode knowledge about missing values in the analysis.
-   `mode_single()` now has an `accept` argument for opting into a less strict check for a single mode, in analogy to `mode_first()`.
-   `mode_first()` had its `first_known` argument renamed to `accept` for consistency with `mode_single()`.
-   Further improvements to the documentation, including vignettes.
