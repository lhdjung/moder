# Mode estimation in R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The moder package determines single or multiple **modes** (most frequent
values). By default, its functions check whether missing values make
this impossible, and return `NA` in this case. Dependency-free.

## Installation

You can install the development version of moder like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("lhdjung/moder")
```
