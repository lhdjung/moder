## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Only used undirected quotation marks in the description text.
* Omitted the redundant "in R" at the end of my title.
* Added a reference in the description field. (The authors' names may be flagged as possibly misspelled.)
* Discussed further references in a vignette.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
